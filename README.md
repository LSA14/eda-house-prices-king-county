## Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis and baseline modeling of housing prices in King County, USA.  
The project focuses on understanding key drivers of price and evaluating simple regression models.

## Dataset
Public housing dataset containing property characteristics such as size, location, and quality.

## Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Linear and Ridge regression
- Polynomial feature expansion

## Results
Property size variables, especially `sqft_living`, show a strong relationship with price.  
Regularization and polynomial features slightly improve model performance.

## Limitations & Next Steps
The analysis is limited by feature availability and model simplicity.  
Future work could include additional features and more advanced modeling techniques.
